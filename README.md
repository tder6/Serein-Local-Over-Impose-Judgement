## Background 

In OI competitions, we often encounter the following questions: How to evaluate my score locally? How to quickly compare when my test point has a large amount of data? How can I determine the time spent on my program?
Our project can effectively solve all these problems

## What can do

- Automatically compile and run the given program and input and answer files, judge the results, and return the runtime
- Judge $\color{green}\texttt{[AC]}$, $\color{red}\texttt{[WA]}$, $\color{gold}\texttt{[CE]}$, $\color{teal}\texttt{[TLE]}$ and other situations
- Supports given time limits

## How to use

In order to use it, you need to prepare your program and test points. Please check our [Wiki](https://github.com/tder6/Serein-Local-Over-Impose-Judgement/wiki) to learn about it

Here are the simplified install methods:

- [Download .zip](https://github.com/tder6/Serein-Local-Over-Impose-Judgement/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
